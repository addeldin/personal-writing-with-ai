## Top-Level
This activity is intended to help instructors guide students through ways of interacting with text generation AI, namely [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt), in the context of a writing class. Rather than produce assignments that can ensure students do not use ChatGPT, the activity focuses on showing students how ChatGPT can be integrated into the writing process in order to show its affordances and limitations.

## Contents
* `introduction.md` provides some context in terms of discussions within academic writing communities about ChatGPT and its potential impact on writing courses and assignments

* `instructional-guide.md` walks the instructor through the work in the class sessions needed to complete this activity
