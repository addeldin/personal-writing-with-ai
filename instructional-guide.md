# Personal Writing with AI Instructional Guide
## Top-Level
This activity is designed to take roughly one week of class sessions with some writing done between class sessions by students. I have written the instructional guide for courses that meet three times per week (for roughly 45 minutes to 1 hour). For more information, see the `Structure` subsection in [introduction.md](introduction.md#structure).

While you can collect submissions each session, I recommend not collecting and grading any writing until the end, excepting maybe collecting a copy to verify the work is being kept up with.

Please note that this guide is just that: a guide. You are welcome to change it as you see fit for your classroom, and I would in fact love to hear about anyone doing so and how they went about the activity.

## Materials and Software Required
Students will need a device that can access the internet, an account with [OpenAI](https://openai.com/), access to [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com), and a way to store and access its outputs. Ideally, students will have access to their own laptops or in-class computers. Students could, if needed, access ChatGPT via their phones and access the outputs later on a separate laptop. Students will also need access to word processing software for writing and submitting written work.

**Note that you will need to check on the day of the first session that ChatGPT or another AI chat is up and usable.**

## Prior to Session 1
### Setup
#### Estimate: 10 minutes
Ask students to come to class with one to two written pages about a personal topic.

 I have provided two examples in this guide that can be used, and obviously both options could be offered to students. Given that students will be sharing the writing with their instructor and talking about their experiences with writing and ChatGPT in class together. While students can avoid speaking to any specifics in their writing in terms of discussions with peers, it is worth letting students know that it will not be turned into the instructor as-is with no further discusssion so that they can make an informed decision about how personal they want their writing to be.

Here are two optional prompts A and B, which will be built on in the instructional guide with further prompts for writing and questions for in-class discussion. In cases where the the distinction in instruction is significant, I will separate the two with a header, but in cases where it is relatively insignificant (like in-class questions differentiated only by asking about a `text` or `location`) I will use bracketed formatted as code, e.g. `[text or location]`.

#### Prompt A
Write about a piece of art or media (what I'll generalize as a "text") that is particularly important to you. What you choose might be what you most enjoy, but focus on picking something that had a profound personal impact on you, helped you to better understand a concept or something about your life, helped you solve an important problem in your life, or otherwise prompted a significant change for you. 

In roughly 2 double spaced pages:
* briefly explain the text and what it's "about" in general terms;
* write about the elements of your life that are important for understanding the impact the text had on you;
* explain how or why the text achieved its effect;
* include at least two specific examples (e.g. scenes in a movie, episodes of a show, characters in a book).

Students should attempt to address the various elements of the prompt cohesively, rather than answering each question individually in sequence.

#### Prompt B
Write about a place that is particularly important to you. You might choose a town, neighborhood, cafe, or other kind of location, but focus on picking somewhere that you can speak to the specifics of, and how it in some way informed or shaped who you are today.

In roughly 2 double spaced pages:
* briefly explain the location;
* write about the elements of your life that are important for understanding the impact the location had on you;
* explain how or why the location achieved its effect;
* include at least two specific examples (e.g. places in the neighborhood, memories, or people).

Students should attempt to address the various elements of the prompt cohesively, rather than answering each question individually in sequence.

 ## Session 1
 ### Writing Reflection
 #### Estimate: 10 to 15 minutes
To begin the session, ask students who are comfortable sharing what they wrote about to do so. If you chose to allow both prompts, you might ask which ones people chose, and why.

You might also ask to each student as they talk about what they wrote, or to the whole class after several students have given examples:
* Was it difficult to think of what to write about? If so, how did you end up picking your subject of focus?
* How did you go about choosing the relevant parts of your life to write about?
* Was it clear from the outset of the writing what impact the `[text or location]` had on you?

### ChatGPT Introduction and Exploration
#### Estimate: 15 to 25 minutes
To start, briefly explain ChatGPT. You can reference the `introduction.md` file in this repository, read a brief explainer article as a guideline such as ["Explainer: ChatGPT - what is OpenAIâ€™s chatbot and what is it used for?"](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-what-is-openais-chatbot-what-is-it-used-2022-12-05/) by Siddharth K. If you have time, you could read through the article together and ask questions throughout the reading.

Some questions to guide this introductory conversation might include:
* Who here has heard of ChatGPT? What did you know about it already?
* Who here has used ChatGPT? What for? What were your impressions of it?

Next, bring up [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) (or an alternative if needed; see the `Instructional Materials` section in [introduction.md](introduction.md#instructional-materials)) on a projector to show the class.

First, demonstrate some straightforward prompts and read the results. I recommend sticking to something covered together in class, but some optional prompts might be:

* What is the best way to write the introduction to a college essay?
* Write a 1 page paper in the style of a college application essay explaining how I could better contribute to society by attending the University of Pittsburgh as a computer science major

For each, ask students whether they think the response meets the expectations of the prompt, and how the response would or would not different from one written by a human being.

Finally, ask:

* How do you think ChatGPT is producing responses? What influences the output?
* How is the output similar to or different from human writing?

### ChatGPT Tinkering
#### Estimate: 15 to 25 minutes
Engage students directly with ChatGPT by rooting it in their writing. To do so, give them a few minutes to do the following:

* Write a prompt for ChatGPT that is most likely to produce writing that resembles what you wrote about for today.

If any students are willing to volunteer their responses to be put into ChatGPT and see the results, then do so. If not, you can come prepared with a pre-generated prompt, such as `explain how the TV show Black Mirror helped me get over my lifelong anxieties about technology`. Again, appealing to a shared text the class has engaged with would be ideal here.

After each response, read it aloud or ask the student to read it aloud. Then, ask them some follow-up questions:

* How close would you say this is to what you wrote?
* What's similar? What's different?
* Did it accurately describe what about the `[text or location]` was important to you?
* If you were to rework your prompt to get it closer to your writing, what would you do?

I recommend doing this with at least 2 students or instructor-generated sample prompts. 

If these two subjects do not come up, it is worth emphasizing them:

1. You need to specify for ChatGPT to `write in the first person` if the student wrote in the first person.
2. You need to add `with specific examples` or some variant of it to get specific details, as was specified in the initial prompt.

### Setting Up Session 2
#### Estimate: 10 minutes
Explain to students that for next time, they will use their prompt to create a writing response, and should rework their prompt at least two or three times to get it closer to what they wrote (including getting a response in the first person and including two specific examples). Then, they should **write between 1 and 2 double spaced pages** comparing their initial writing to the ChatGPT output.

Guiding questions should include some variant(s) of the following:

* How close would you say ChatGPT's writing is to what you wrote? What's similar? What's different?
* Did it accurately describe what about the `[text or location]` was important to you?
* What examples did it select? Are they the same examples you chose?
* What did it completely get wrong or miss that is important to you?
* Did it give you new ideas, examples, or topics to write about that you had not considered in your initial draft?

Students can answer the questions one by one or address the various elements of the prompt cohesively.

If there is time left, encourage students to create an OpenAI profile via their phones, tablets, or laptops. For those that cannot do so, encourage them to work further on the prompt they will give to ChatGPT.

## Session 2
### Writing Reflection
#### Estimate: 10 to 15 minutes
To begin the session, ask students generally to share the prompt they submitted to ChatGPT, how they changed it from the initial prompt they wrote in class in session 1, and what they think about the writing ChatGPT produced as a result.

From there, if questions listed in the [Setting Up Session 2](instructional-guide.md#setting-up-session-2) subsection above have not been addressed, use them to prompt further examples from students.

### ChatGPT General Discussion
#### 20 to 30 minutes
Following the initial reflection, initiate a more general conversation about ChatGPT and its role in the writing process.

* Did using ChatGPT at all influence how you feel about its potential use as a student? Are you more or less likely to use it?
* If you are someone who would use ChatGPT as part of the writing process, how would you incorporate it?
* What are the ethics of presenting text wholly written by ChatGPT for writing assignments?
    * What about using paragraphs?
    * What about using it to determine the structure, but rewriting each paragraph to be in your own voice?
    * What (other) ways might ChatGPT be ethically incorporated into the writing process for something like personal writing?

Then, broaden the conversation to ChatGPT's role and potential impact more generally.

* Do you feel like ChatGPT is simply another tool, like automatic spelling and grammar checkers or a calculator? Or is it fundamentally different than those kinds of tools?
* Having used ChatGPT, does it feel like something exciting and new, or is it of uncanny and off-putting? Or is it something else entirely?
* Do you think ChatGPT will impact your academic career, or what you do after you graduate?
* Which industries or communities might ChatGPT impact? Do you think it'll make a big splash, fizzle out, or be restricted to a few very specific use cases?
* Do you think that ChatGPT will have a net positive or negative impact on society, or on you personally?
* Do you plan to use ChatGPT in the future, and if so in what contexts?

### ChatGPT Free Write
#### Estimate: 5 to 10 minutes
If time allows for it, give students some time to write down their overall thoughts on using ChatGPT in the writing process and on the technology more generally before setting up the final collection of writing they will turn in for this activity in session 3.

### Setting Up Session 3
#### Estimate: 10 minutes
Explain to students that for next time, they will be turning in the "final products" of this activity, which includes three elements:

1. A revised version of their original personal writing. They are welcome to use their initial writing as a template, but should make any adjustments prompted by reading ChatGPT's version, whether it be new examples or an adjusted structure of how the ideas are presented.
2. A printout, PDF, or transcript of the final version of the prompt they gave ChatGPT, and and the ChatGPT output in response to that prompt.
3. Their initial reflective writing turned in for session 2, revised to address two new guiding questions:
   * Did ChatGPT influence your revision of your original personal writing? If so, how, and if not, why not?
   * Do you think ChatGPT can produce or be part of the creation of personal writing? Why or why not?

## Session 3
### Writing Reflection
#### Estimate: 5 minutes
Technically, this component of the activity can be cut entirely if you feel like the in-class discussion hit all the main points. However, it might be useful to ask students the following questions, two of which reiterate the new part of the reflective writing.

* Did ChatGPT influence your revision of your original personal writing? If so, how, and if not, why not?
* Do you think ChatGPT can produce or be part of the creation of personal writing? Why or why not?
* What do you think will be the role of ChatGPT in writing in college, and how do you feel about that role?
* If ChatGPT can produce an A+ essay consistently across several courses, is that a problem? Does it signal a threat to learning writing in college, or do instructors need to change something about writing assignments?
* Is writing produced in response to a prompt by a person fundamentally different than the writing produced by an AI?

## Guiding Realizations
1. ChatGPT produces writing in response to a parsed prompt using a large corpus of written content on the internet, which has similarities and differences to how humans respond to prompts based on the sum of their experiences based on interactions with and writings by other people.
2. ChatGPT can be incorporated into human writing in a variety of ways, and students can use ChatGPT in ways that do not violate academic or personal integrity.
3. ChatGPT will have an impact on writing in society, and students can learn how to use it effectively to understand what roles it may have and how they feel about those roles.
