# Personal Writing with AI Instructional Guide
## Top-Level
This activity is designed to take roughly one week of class sessions with some writing done between class sessions by students. I have written the instructional guide for courses that meet three times per week (for roughly 45 minutes to 1 hour). For classes that meet twice per week, there will need to be some reworking, potentially with in-class time to work on writing or interact with ChatGPT.

Please note that this guide is just that: a guide. You are welcome to change it as you see fit for your classroom, and I would in fact love to hear about anyone doing so and how they went about the activity.

## Materials and Software Required
Students will need a device that can access the internet, an account with [OpenAI](https://openai.com/), access to [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com), and a way to store and access its outputs. Ideally, students will have access to their own laptops or in-class computers. Students could, if needed, access ChatGPT via their phones and access the outputs later on a separate laptop. **Note that you will need to check on the day of the first session that ChatGPT or another AI chat is up and usable.

Students will also need access to word processing software for writing and submitting written work.

## Prior to Session 1
## Setup
Ask students to come to class with one to two written pages about a personal topic. I have provided two examples in this guide that can be used, and obviously both options could be offered to students. Given that students will be sharing the writing with their instructor and talking about their experiences with writing and ChatGPT in class together. While students can avoid speaking to any specifics in their writing in terms of discussions with peers, it is worth letting students know that it will not be turned into the instructor as-is with no further discusssion so that they can make an informed decision about how personal they want their writing to be.

Here are two optional prompts A and B, which will be built on in the instructional guide with further prompts for writing and questions for in-class discussion. In cases where the the distinction in instruction is significant, I will separate the two with a header, but in cases where it is relatively insignificant (like in-class questions differentiated only by asking about a `text` or `location`) I will use bracketed formatted as code, e.g. `[text or location]`.

### Prompt A
Write about a piece of art or media (what I'll generalize as a "text") that is particularly important to you. What you choose might be what you most enjoy, but focus on picking something that had a profound personal impact on you, helped you to better understand a concept or something about your life, helped you solve an important problem in your life, or otherwise prompted a significant change for you. 

In roughly 1 to 2 double spaced pages:
* briefly explain the text and what it's "about" in general terms;
* write about the elements of your life that are important for understanding the impact the text had on you;
* explain how or why the text achieved its effect. 

Note that you should focus on the generalities at this stage of writing You do not need to include specific examples from the text, but will instead write about those examples as you iterate on this writing.

### Prompt B
Write about a place that is particularly important to you. You might choose a town, neighborhood, cafe, or other kind of location, but focus on picking somewhere that you can speak to the specifics of, and how it in some way informed or shaped who you are today.

In roughly 1 to 2 double spaced pages:
* briefly explain the location;
* write about the elements of your life that are important for understanding the impact the location had on you;
* explain how or why the location achieved its effect. 

 Note that you should focus on the generalities at this stage of writing You do not need to include specific experiences or moments yet, but will instead write about those examples as you iterate on this writing.

 ## Session 1
 ### Writing Reflection
 #### Estimate: 10 minutes
To begin the session, ask students who are comfortable sharing what they wrote about to do so. If you chose to allow both prompts, you might ask which ones people chose, and why.

You might also ask:
* Was it difficult to think of what to write about? If so, how did you end up picking your subject of focus?
* How did you go about choosing the relevant parts of your life to write about?
* Was it clear from the outset of the writing what impact the `[text or location]` had on you?

### ChatGPT Introduction and Exploration
#### Estimate: 15 to 25 minutes
To start, briefly explain ChatGPT. You can reference the `introduction.md` file in this repository, read a brief explainer article as a guideline such as ["Explainer: ChatGPT - what is OpenAIâ€™s chatbot and what is it used for?"](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-what-is-openais-chatbot-what-is-it-used-2022-12-05/) by Siddharth K. If you have time, you could read through the article together and ask questions throughout the reading.

Some questions to guide this introductory conversation might include:
* Who here has heard of ChatGPT? What did you know about it already?
* Who here has used ChatGPT? What for? What were your impressions of it?

Next, bring up [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) (or an alternative if needed; see the `Instructional Materials` section in `introduction.md`) on a projector to show the class.

First, demonstrate some straightforward prompts and read the results. I recommend sticking to something covered together in class, but some optional prompts might be:

* what is the best way to write the introduction to a college essay?
* write a 1 page paper in the style of a college application essay explaining how I could better contribute to society by attending the University of Pittsburgh as a computer science major

For each, ask students whether they think the response meets the expectations of the prompt, and how the response would or would not different from one written by a human being.

After this initial discovery phase, guide a more general discussion, with questions such as:

* Do you think ChatGPT will impact your academic career, or what you do after you graduate?
* Which industries or communities might ChatGPT impact?
* Do you think that ChatGPT will have a net positive or negative impact on society, or on you personally?

One question that I find useful as a conversation starter, having read many online comparisons between ChatGPT and calculators, is:

* Is ChatGPT to writing what a calculator is to math?

I have my own opinions, but that's not important here.

### ChatGPT Tinkering
#### Estimate: 15 to 25 minutes
Engage students directly with ChatGPT by rooting it in their writing. To do so, give them a few minutes to do the following:

* Write a prompt for ChatGPT that is most likely to produce writing that resembles what you wrote about for today.

If any students are willing to volunteer their responses to be put into ChatGPT and see the results, then do so. If not, you can come prepared with a pre-generated prompt, such as `explain how the TV show *Black Mirror* helped me get over my lifelong anxieties about technology`. Again, appealing to a shared text the class has engaged with would be ideal here.

After each response, read it aloud or ask the student to read it aloud. Then, ask them some follow-up questions:

* How close would you say this is to what you wrote?
* What's similar? What's different?
* Did it accurately describe what about the `[text or location]` was important to you?
* If you were to rework your prompt to get it closer to your writing, what would you do?

I recommend doing this with at least 2 students or instructor-generated sample prompts.

### Setting Up Session 2
#### Estimate: 10 minutes
Explain to students that for next time, they will use their prompt to create a writing response, and should rework their prompt at least two or three times to get it closer to what they wrote. Then, they should **write one page** about the process of creating their prompt, and addressing similar questions to those asked in class:

* How close would you say this is to what you wrote?
* What's similar? What's different?
* Did it accurately describe what about the `[text or location]` was important to you?
* What did it completely get wrong or miss that is important to you?

If there is time left, encourage students to create an OpenAI profile via their phones, tablets, or laptops. For those that cannot do so, encourage them to work further on the prompt they will give to ChatGPT.

## Guiding Realizations
1. Although the computer mechanically produces new instances of the genre based on pre-defined rules, there are still subjective decisions about what a genre is and how to represent it that are embodied in the code.
2. There is a distinction between *programming* as a conceptual process of shaping real-world things or ideas in terms that can be understood and processed by the computer, and *coding* as enacting those ideas in machine-readable language.
3. To define something like a genre in a way that can be interpreted by a computer does not mean that this definition is the only or most correct way to understand what that genre is. By virtue of making the genre fungible to the logic of the comptuer, certain understandings of the genre were prioritized and others, de-prioritized.
