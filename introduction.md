# "Personal Writing with AI" by Addison Eldin
## Top-Level
### Content
The "Personal Writing with AI" activity attempts to help students understand how AI large language models can integrate into the writing process, and how they might make use of AI in their own writing practice. It takes as a presupposition that these AI, such as [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt), are here to stay, and that instructors can and should speak to the role of the technology in the writing process rather than assume we can keep it out of student view into the future. While I recognize the value of writing without AI, which can only realistically be enforced with a return to in-class writing exams, I think that teaching students how to use this technology effectively is both more viable and potentially more fruitful for their own future work, where they will have access to these tools in whatever contexts they find themselves writing in as they continue their college and post-college careers. Further, I believe that such interactions can foster conversations about these AI in terms of how they work, their affordances, their limitations, and what they might change about writing in society going forward.

### Structure
This activity is intended for writing-focused courses, namely first-year writing or digital writing courses. It is designed to take roughly one week of class sessions with some writing done between class sessions by students. I have written the instructional guide for courses that meet three times per week (for roughly 45 minutes to 1 hour). For classes that meet twice per week, there will need to be some reworking, potentially with in-class time to work on writing or interact with ChatGPT.

## Context
"Personal Writing with AI" was designed in response to ongoing conversations about the role of text generation AI in college courses, namely writing courses, as my background is in English composition and rhetoric.

At the University of Pittsburgh, where I am working on my PhD, there is a [resource page for faculty](https://teaching.pitt.edu/resources/chatgpt-resources-for-faculty/) that provides some useful starting points. In their list of "inclusive teaching strategies," they include: 

> "Develop assignments that cannot successfully be completed using AI tools. This might involve having students complete part or all of the assignment during class or designing assignments that include tasks that are outside of ChatGPTâ€™s current capabilities. Examples might include assignments that require students to draw from recent events or class discussions or assignments that incorporate research and citations which you can then check."

While I think such an approach is useful, I want to come at it from the other angle: designing writing assignments that make use of ChatGPT to clarify how it works and can be utilized. For example, consider an article linked on the above Pitt page, Eric Prochaska's ["Embrace the Bot: Designing Writing Assignments in the Face of AI"](https://www.facultyfocus.com/articles/course-design-ideas/embrace-the-bot-designing-writing-assignments-in-the-face-of-ai/). His third method for teaching with or around AI is an approach called "If you can't beat them, join them," which includes rhetorical analysis of AI-generated responses, revising such resposes, presenting on those responses, or otherwise interacting with results from AI text generation. I think this is in the right direction, but could go even further and do more to integrate student and AI writing.

Two articles from *Inside Higher Ed* provide more opportunities for working with students to make use of text generation AI. Susan D'Agostino, in her article ["ChatGPT Advice Academics Can Use Now"](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2023/01/12/academic-experts-offer-advice-chatgpt), features suggestions from several professors, including this advice from NYU's Nancy Gleason:

> "Next, consider the tools relative to your course. What are the cognitive tasks students need to perform without AI assistance? When should students rely on AI assistance? Where can an AI aid facilitate a better outcome? Are there efficiencies in grading that can be gained? Are new rubrics and assignment descriptions needed? Will you add an AI writing code of conduct to your syllabus? Do these changes require structural shifts in timetabling, class size or number of teaching assistants?"

Note the emphasis on an integrative approach, identifying what skills students need in the context of the course, and what on the other hand might be reasonably offloaded. In an example from a class I am teaching right now, a literature course, for short writings I often ask students to do in-text citations for works included on the syllabus, with no expectation of a specific format like MLA or APA nor a works cited list unless a text from outside of the syllabus is referenced. The reason is that the course is not intended to teach them proper citational formats, but rather to understand how to include important information in their writing such that I can verify and see the context of what they choose to include. The point is not more rigorous citational standards, but communicating where their information comes from. How might writing be taught to consider what is important for students to do, while helping them identify when and where AI is appropriate as part of that process. This perspective is echoed in Jeremy Weissman's less-rosy eyed ["ChatGPT Is a Plague Upon Education"](https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2023/02/09/chatgpt-plague-upon-education-opinion), where he suggests the development of student "familiarity and even expertise with these programs, since such skills will likely be in demand in the job market."

Others in D'agostino's article provide fruitful suggestions. University of Mississippi's Robert Cummings suggests experimentation, a building of "AI literacy" so that students can understand the tools they have available as writers. North Carolina State University's Paul Fyfe gives assignments where students "cheat" through use of ChatGPT as an opportunity to start a conversation about the technology. College of Marin's Anna Mills suggests a back-and-forth between student expectations and understandings on the one hand, and outputs by ChatGPT on the other.

In each of these cases, I think there is a sense that the technology exists and will not vanish; it may very well be essential to future work in variety of job markets; and that there is an opportunity to help students understand how to intentionally make use of the technology as part of a broader writing process. Thus, this activity is intended to build on these ideas with a specific implementation.

## Implementation
To identify whether this activity and set of assignments are appropriate for your class, I think there are three broad criteria to consider.

1. Is personal writing an appropriate subject of focus for your course?
2. Is your course amenable to an iterative writing process that relies on student reflection, with several shorter assignments that lead into a longer assignment?
3. Is the role of ChatGPT as a kind of writing tecnhology an appropriate subject for your course?

If the answer to these three questions is "yes," then I think this activity is appropriate for the course.

## Instructional Materials
The instructional materials for this activity include this introduction and an instructional guide, which walks through the activity and assignment structure. The instructional guide can be found in this repository as `instructional-guide.md`.
