# "Writing with AI" by Addison Eldin
## Top-Level
The "Writing with AI" activity attempts to help studnets understand the writing process, how AI "writes," and how they might make use of AI in their own writing practice. It takes as a presupposition that such AI, such as [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt), are here to stay, and that instructors can and should speak to the role of the technology in the writing process rather than assume we can keep it out of student view into the future. While I recognize the value of writing without AI, which can only realistically be enforced with a return to in-class writing exams, I think that teaching students how to use this technology effectively is both more viable and potentially more fruitful for their own future work, where they will have access to these tools in whatever contexts they find themselves writing in as they continue their college and post-college careers.

## Context
This activity is intended for writing-focused courses, namely first-year writing or digital writing courses.

## Implementation
Despite the idiosyncratic context from which this activity arose, I think there are three broad principles that can help someone identify if this activity is a good fit for their classroom.

1. The course should, in part or in whole, speak to digital technology as at once social and technical, or *sociotechnical*. That is, some part of the class should speak to how ideas such as digital representation, digital computation, and/or encoding are relevant in human use of the technology.<sup>3</sup>  Relatedly, the course should spend some time prior to the activity discussing these concepts—whether in those terms or through a focus on programming and code—to prepare students for the conversation about the Strachey implementations that will prompt students' own creative work in developing a generator.<sup>4</sup> 
2. Students should, generally, have some experience with writing in college. The instructor will guide students through the basics of rhetorical analysis by considering the rhetorical context, purpose, and norms of a written genre, namely the love letter. Students who have taken a first-year writing course or otherwise learned about different kinds of academic writing—e.g. what differentiates an essay and a research paper—will be better situated to engage in this conversation. A class made up of students who are new to college and have no prior college writing experience might find this conversation more difficult, which could make the rest of the activity difficult.
3. While students do not need to know how to code, the instructor must have basic facility with at least one higher level programming language that enables the manipulation of text, e.g. Python or Javascript. The basic skills required include using strings, variables, and lists in conjunction with each other. Further, the instructor will need to be able to present the code and its outputs in sequence with text that contextualizes the code with some kind of projection technology.

If these three principles are met, I believe that the activity could be implemented into a course regardless of its home department. While the rhetorical analysis part of the assignment might seem limiting in terms of instructor comfort with guiding the discussion, I think that the questions provided and the instructor's own awareness of the contexts, purposes, and norms of written genres in their own field are sufficient for facilitating the rhetorical analysis in the activity.
 
## Instructional Materials
All instructional materials for this activity—including an instructional guide, a student program and its implementation in code, and a template generator in Markdown and Python using Jupyter Notebooks—are available via a GitHub repository (https://github.com/addeldin/genre-generators).

## Notes
<sup>1</sup> The two implementations used are Matt Sephton's (https://www.gingerbeardman.com/loveletter/), which presents outputs of the generator, and Annette Vee's (https://jsfiddle.net/nettework/6f7abaaa/), which presents outputs along with underlying code in Javascript.
<sup>2</sup> For examples of relevant approaches to the study of genre from a composition and rhetoric perspective that account for the rhetorical dimensions of written works in social context, see the cited works by Rebecca Nowacek (28), Charles Bazerman (69), and Carolyn Miller (59).
<sup>3</sup> By *digital representation*, *digital computation*, and *encoding*, I refer to the fact that to represent a concept using a computer, that concept must be represented digitally, or via discrete numbers, generally the binary digits 0 and 1, which are then computed in various combinations to produce new results. For example, to represent the continuous color spectrum, colors are encoded via digital representation by encoding any color as a combination of 256 possible shades of red, green, and blue. While over 16 million colors is a lot, it is not a direct reflection of the full color spectrum, which due to being continuous necessarily contains an infinite number of possible colors.
<sup>4</sup> For resources that can develop an understanding of digital representation, digital computation, digital encoding, and/or the basic concepts of programming for the instructor as well as the students, consider Karen Hao and Jonathan Stray's relatively short breakdown of how a courtroom sentencing algorithm digitally represents ideas of justice and risk; Charles Petzold's book *Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software*, in particular the chapter "Bit by Bit by Bit"; or Paul Ford's in-depth but highly readable Businessweek article, "What Is Code?" All of these texts were used in both terms that I taught "Digital Humanity," with "What Is Code?" being assigned and discussed the class session prior to the start of this activity.
